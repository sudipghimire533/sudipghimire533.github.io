Hey there, welcome to my totally rad portfolio website! I'm Sudip Ghimire, and if you haven't heard of me yet, well... you will. I'm kind of a big deal in the Blockchain Development world. No biggie.

When I'm not crushing it as a blockchain engineer (aka a professional wizard), I'm busy wielding my other superpowers - like writing, philosophizing, jamming out to music, and debating politics with my imaginary friends.

I made this website to show off my mad skills and connect with other like-minded, totally awesome people who share my passions. So if you're into music, tech, politics, writing, or philosophy (or just think I'm pretty cool), stick around and let's make some magic happen.

But seriously, no haters allowed. Only cool kids need apply.
