In 2018, I discovered my passion for IT while I was still in school. My teachers gave me a great foundation, but being a wanna-be tech genius, I taught myself how to program and build real things all by myself!

After school, I kept on learning and growing. I joined internships, started freelancing, and even took on some exciting projects. Now, I'm on my way to even bigger and better things.

But I couldn't have done it without my squad! Shoutout to my friends who have my back, my family who supports me, and everyone who sent some good vibes my way. You guys are my personal army of superheroes, and I feel so grateful for all of you! <i class='fas fa-heart text-pink-500'></i>
